*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying
“pure sampling” of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI
with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful
notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation
data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and
PI) to support engineering design.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation
campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub)
that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat
transfer to fluid-suspended particles\[1\]. These simulations were
carried out to help study a novel design of [solar
receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power),
though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device
design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your
local `./data/` folder.

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An
example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial
simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with
particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain
(RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right).
Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent
fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect
heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image
shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are “hot spots” where hot
particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap`
gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at
various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

### **q1** Perform your “initial checks” to get a sense of the data.

**Observations**:

- The dataset has 22 columns (features) and 140 observations (data
  points).

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the
normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat
transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column
of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions
`W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

``` r
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx
ggplot(df_psaap, aes(x = x, y = T_norm, group = idx, color = factor(idx))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Normalized Temperature Rise (T_norm) vs. Channel Location (x)",
    x = "Channel Location (x)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (T_norm)",
    color = "Simulation idx"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation
sets.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors
(features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we
should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to
include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the
flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because
fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and
thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables—at least at a *high level*—can help us to
avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You’ll explore
this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance
df_validate_eval <- df_validate %>%
  add_predictions(fit_baseline, var = "pred_baseline") %>%
  add_predictions(fit_cheat, var = "pred_cheat") %>%
  add_predictions(fit_nonphysical, var = "pred_nonphysical")

calc_rmse <- function(actual, predicted) {
  sqrt(mean((actual - predicted)^2))
}

rmse_baseline <- calc_rmse(df_validate_eval$T_norm, df_validate_eval$pred_baseline)
rmse_cheat <- calc_rmse(df_validate_eval$T_norm, df_validate_eval$pred_cheat)
rmse_nonphysical <- calc_rmse(df_validate_eval$T_norm, df_validate_eval$pred_nonphysical)

tibble(
  Model = c("Baseline (x)", "Cheat (avg_T)", "Non-physical (idx)"),
  RMSE = c(rmse_baseline, rmse_cheat, rmse_nonphysical)
)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 2
    ##   Model               RMSE
    ##   <chr>              <dbl>
    ## 1 Baseline (x)       0.284
    ## 2 Cheat (avg_T)      0.232
    ## 3 Non-physical (idx) 0.399

**Observations**:

- Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
  - The most accurate model is the Cheat model (`avg_T`), with the
    lowest RMSE of 0.2318.
  - The least accurate model is the Non-physical model (`idx`), with the
    highest RMSE of 0.3988.
- What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective
  predictor?
  - `avg_T` is an Output variable.

    It’s so effective because `T_norm` is calculated directly from it:
    T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f.

  - ​So `avg_T` almost directly determines the target, making it a
    near-perfect predictor (but also a cheat).
- Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new*
  value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
  - No, we would not have access to `avg_T` when predicting `T_norm` for
    a new scenario.
  - It’s an output variable, derived from the simulation itself, not an
    input we control or measure ahead of time.
  - Thus, `avg_T` is not a valid predictor in practice — including it
    would be like using the answer to predict itself.
- What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical
  meaning?
  - `idx` is a Metadata variable.
  - It identifies the simulation run, but it has no physical meaning as
    it’s just a label or ID.  
    Using it in modeling risks overfitting to arbitrary run IDs without
    generalizing to new simulations.

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from
fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

``` r
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <- 
  df_train %>% 
  # lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ L + W + U_0 + N_p + k_f + T_f)
  # lm(formula = T_norm ~ L - W - U_0 - N_p - k_f - T_f)

summary(fit_q4)
```

**Observations**:

- Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories
  do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of
  the model?
  - Excluded columns:
    - `idx` (Metadata)

    - `avg_q`, `avg_T`, `rms_T`, `T_norm` (Outputs)
  - Why exclude them:
    - `avg_T`, `avg_q`, `rms_T` are output variables that depend on the
      simulation result, and including them would leak information from
      the result we’re trying to predict, defeating the purpose of
      modeling.

    - `idx` is a metadata label, not a physical quantity — it provides
      no generalizable predictive power and may lead to overfitting.
- Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?
  - W (channel width) and T_f (fluid inlet temperature) are
    statistically significant predictors.
- What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression
  coefficient for `T_f`?
  - Only `T_f` is in the model:
    - Coefficient for `T_f`: −0.004783

    - `x` is not in the model as it was excluded intentionally to
      isolate effects of upstream input variables only.
- What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the
  standard deviation of `T_f`?
  - sd(x) = 0.2805121
  - sd(T_f) = 38.94204
- How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients
  for `x` and `T_f`?
  - The regression coefficient for `T_f` is -0.004783:  
    So a 1-unit increase in `T_f` reduces `T_norm` by ~0.00478.  
    Since `T_f` has large natural variation (SD ~39), this effect
    becomes more impactful in practice.
  - `x` isn’t included in this model, but in earlier models (like
    `fit_baseline`), its effect could be interpreted relative to the SD
    of `x` to compare predictive strength.
- Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on
  the output `T_norm`; so they are all “significant” in that sense. What
  does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance
  for interpreting regression coefficients?
  - A variable may have real physical importance but appear not
    statistically significant due to:
    - Correlation with other predictors (multicollinearity)

    - Small sample size

    - Low variability in the data

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let’s revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction
intervals (PI). Let’s fit a very simple model to these data, one which
only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We’ll
also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the
`setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the
objects they are attempting to capture:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    size = 0.5
  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )
```

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the
mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet
we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation`
observations.

**Punchline**:

- Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
- Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but
the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to
*narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions.
Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in
uncertainty. We’ll see this phenomenon in action with the following
task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

**Observations**:

- Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this
  predicted-vs-actual plot?
  - The `fit_q4` model (left side) is more accurate than the
    `fit_simple` (`x only`) model. I can tell because:

    - Points are closer to the diagonal 1:1 line (ideal prediction
      line).
    - The vertical error bars (difference between predicted and actual)
      are generally shorter.

    <!-- -->

    - The spread around the line is tighter, indicating better alignment
      between predicted and actual `T_norm`.
- Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put
  differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
  - The `fit_q4` model is also more confident as its prediction
    intervals are narrower. You can see this in the shorter vertical
    error bars in the left panel (`model: q4`) compared to the right
    panel (`model: x only`).
- How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make
  a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
  - The **`fit_simple` model** only needs **1 predictor**: `x` (channel
    location).
  - The **`fit_q4` model** uses **6 predictors**: `L`, `W`, `U_0`,
    `N_p`, `k_f`, `T_f`.

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every
reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the
best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for
example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our
control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example,
it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by
having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is
*patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component*
that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases—human behavior and variable material properties—we would
be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are
at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some
inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that
uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the
uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as
predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term
$\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue
strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate
successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in
the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according
to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team
a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed
design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below
(use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level`
argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the
appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which
variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have
chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing
a CI or PI for the design prediction.

``` r
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`
fit_q6 <- lm(T_norm ~ N_p + k_f + T_f + rho_f + mu_f + lam_f + C_fp +
               rho_p + d_p + C_pv + h + I_0 + eps_p,
             data = df_train)

df_predict <- df_psaap %>%
  select(N_p, k_f, T_f, rho_f, mu_f, lam_f, C_fp, rho_p, d_p, C_pv, h, I_0, eps_p) %>%
  mutate(
    x = 1.0,
    L = 0.2,
    W = 0.04,
    U_0 = 1.0
  ) %>%
  select(x, L, W, U_0, everything())

df_results <- df_predict %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_q6, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi", level = pr_level)

range_pi <- range(df_results$pi_lwr, df_results$pi_upr)
mean_pred <- mean(df_results$pi_fit)

tibble(
  Lower80 = range_pi[1],
  Upper80 = range_pi[2],
  MeanPredictedTnorm = mean_pred
)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   Lower80 Upper80 MeanPredictedTnorm
    ##     <dbl>   <dbl>              <dbl>
    ## 1  -0.889    2.68              0.770

``` r
df_validate_pi <- df_validate %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_q6, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi", level = pr_level)

within_interval <- df_validate_pi %>%
  mutate(within = T_norm >= pi_lwr & T_norm <= pi_upr)

mean(within_interval$within)
```

    ## [1] 0.65

**Recommendation**:

- How much do you trust your model? Why?
  - I moderately trust the model because it is trained on a reasonably
    sized dataset with physically meaningful predictors, but the wide
    prediction interval (from about −0.89 to 2.68) suggests that
    significant uncertainty remains due to uncontrolled variables.
- What kind of interval—confidence or prediction—would you use for this
  task, and why?
  - A prediction interval is appropriate, because we want to estimate
    the range of possible `T_norm` outcomes at the design point, not
    just the average. The team needs to design for individual outcomes,
    not for the mean behavior.
- What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you
  predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the
  validation data*; don’t just use one single interval!) How does this
  compare with `pr_level`?
  - 65% of validation cases fall within the predicted 80% intervals,
    which suggests that the interval estimates are well calibrated and
    trustworthy for decision-making.
- What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan
  around?
  - I recommend the design team plan around a T_norm range of
    approximately −0.89 to 2.68, which captures 80% of expected outcomes
    under their proposed design. This will ensure safe and efficient
    operation under most likely conditions.
- Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
  - Consider constraining or monitoring additional variables (examples:
    `T_f`, `N_p`, `I_0`) to reduce uncertainty.
  - Avoid operating close to system thresholds if this range could
    exceed safety limits.
  - If precision is critical, consider adding sensors or controls for
    the most influential uncontrolled variables.

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend
which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could
do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An
exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the
variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
